# üò¢ SadCoin - The Saddest DeFi Project on Ethereum

A comprehensive smart contract ecosystem for "Let's Write an E-Mail - The Game" where sadness is actually good and happiness is discouraged.

## üé≠ Project Overview

SadCoin is a satirical productivity RPG that mimics corporate tools while secretly being an RPG. Players write fake emails, complete absurd mini-games, and receive AI feedback, all while earning increasingly sad tokens and achievements.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Tokens

- **SADCoin ($SAD)** - Primary currency used to play the game and stake for rewards
- **FEELS** - Emotional token earned through staking or completing minigames

### Smart Contracts

1. **SADCoin.sol** - ERC-20 token with sad-themed functions
2. **FEELS.sol** - ERC-20 token for emotional rewards with damage tracking
3. **StakingContract.sol** - Stake SADCoin to earn FEELS with Chainlink Automation
4. **GameRewards.sol** - Complete games to earn FEELS with Chainlink VRF randomness
5. **ConversionContract.sol** - Convert between tokens with Chainlink Price Feeds
6. **NFTClaim.sol** - Claim achievement NFTs based on email interactions

### Chainlink Integrations

- **VRF v2.5 (Verifiable Random Function)** - Used in GameRewards and ConversionContract for random outcomes with subscription model
- **Price Feeds** - Used in ConversionContract for ETH/USD or AVAX/USD pricing to purchase SADCoin
- **Automation** - Used in StakingContract and ConversionContract for automated operations
- **Functions** - Used in NFTClaim for off-chain email verification

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) installed
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed
- Basic understanding of Solidity and smart contracts

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd sadcoind
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
forge install
```

3. Compile contracts:
```bash
forge build
```

4. Run tests:
```bash
forge test
```

## üìã Deployment Guide

### Environment Setup

1. Create a `.env` file with your private key:
```env
PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```

2. Update contract addresses in deployment scripts with actual Chainlink service addresses for your target network.

### Sepolia Testnet Deployment

```bash
forge script script/DeploySepolia.s.sol:DeploySepoliaScript --rpc-url sepolia --broadcast --verify
```

### Avalanche Mainnet Deployment

```bash
forge script script/DeployAvalanche.s.sol:DeployAvalancheScript --rpc-url avalanche --broadcast --verify
```

### Generic Deployment (Other Networks)

```bash
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:DeployScript --rpc-url <network> --broadcast --verify
```

### Post-Deployment Setup

1. **Configure Chainlink VRF v2.5**:
   - Create subscription at [vrf.chain.link](https://vrf.chain.link/)
   - Add deployed contracts as VRF consumers
   - Fund VRF subscription with LINK tokens
   - Note: Contracts use subscription model with LINK payment

2. **Set up Chainlink Automation**:
   - Register StakingContract for reward distribution
   - Register ConversionContract for daily rate updates

3. **Configure Chainlink Functions**:
   - Set up email verification endpoints
   - Update NFTClaim contract with proper router address

### Network-Specific VRF v2.5 Addresses

- VRF Coordinator: `0x5CE8D5A2BC84beb22a398CCA51996F7930313D61`

- LINK Token: `0x5947BB275c521040051D82396192181b413227A3`

## üéÆ How to Use

### For Players

1. **Purchase SADCoin**: Send ETH to ConversionContract to buy SAD at $0.01 each
2. **Stake for Rewards**: Stake SADCoin in StakingContract to earn FEELS over time
3. **Play Games**: Complete minigames through GameRewards to earn bonus FEELS
4. **Convert Tokens**: Convert FEELS back to SADCoin at daily random rates
5. **Claim NFTs**: Achieve email-based milestones to claim sad achievement NFTs

### For Developers

#### Interact with SADCoin
```solidity
// Mint sadness to an address (only authorized minters)
sadCoin.mintSadness(recipient, amount);

// Burn tokens with a sad reason
sadCoin.burnWithSadReason(amount, "Lost my job, very sad");

// Check someone's sadness level
uint256 sadness = sadCoin.getSadnessLevel(user);
```

#### Interact with FEELS
```solidity
// Generate feelings (only authorized minters)
feels.generateFeelings(user, amount, "Staking rewards");

// Voluntary suffering
feels.sufferVoluntarily(amount, "Self-inflicted emotional damage");

// Check emotional damage
uint256 damage = feels.getEmotionalDamage(user);
```

#### Staking Operations
```solidity
// Stake sadness
staking.stakeSadness(amount);

// Request unstake (requires waiting period)
staking.requestUnstake();

// Harvest feelings
staking.harvestFeelings();
```

## üéØ Game Economics

### Conversion Rates
The system uses 5 predetermined "sad" conversion rates that change daily via Chainlink VRF:
- 11 FEELS = 1 SAD (least sad)
- 42 FEELS = 1 SAD (moderately sad)
- 69 FEELS = 1 SAD (quite sad)
- 111 FEELS = 1 SAD (very sad)
- 420 FEELS = 1 SAD (ultimate sadness)

### Staking Rewards
- Base rate: 42 FEELS per hour per staked SAD
- Minimum stake: 69 SAD
- Unstaking delay: 7 hours (420 minutes of sadness)

### Game Rewards
- Base reward: 111 FEELS
- Score-based multipliers (inverse relationship - lower scores get more rewards)
- Random multipliers from 0.5x to 4.2x via Chainlink VRF

## üìä Contract Addresses

## üß™ Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
forge test

# Run tests with verbosity
forge test -vvv

# Run specific test file
forge test --match-path test/SADCoin.t.sol

# Run specific test function
forge test --match-test testMintSadness
```

## üìà Gas Optimization

The contracts use Solidity 0.8.26 with:
- Optimizer enabled (200 runs)
- Via-IR compilation for complex contracts
- ReentrancyGuard for security
- Efficient storage patterns

## üîê Security Considerations

- All contracts use OpenZeppelin's battle-tested libraries
- Access control via Ownable and AccessControl patterns
- ReentrancyGuard protection on state-changing functions
- Chainlink services for secure randomness and data feeds
- Comprehensive test coverage
